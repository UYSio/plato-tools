I reminisced with some friends about technology firsts the other day, like our first C or Perl-based CGI scripts, writing Basic on an Acorn, or this little gem from when I worked at [beatthatquote.com](http://beatthatquote.com/) back in the day.

_So, I'll just email myself this Ajax magic so I can use it in my other projects..._
